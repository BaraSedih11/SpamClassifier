This repository contains a simple spam classifier built using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The Spam Classifier is a project aimed at detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes a dataset of labeled messages to train a machine learning model to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

## Features

- Utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn for model training.
- Implements various NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and classification algorithms.
- Provides easy-to-use scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Contents

- `SpamClassifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of polynomial regression using Python.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.


## Requirements
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/SpamClassifier.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd SpamClassifier
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `SpamClassifier.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how polynomial regression is implemented using Python.
