This repository contains a simple spam classifier built using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The Spam Classifier is a project aimed at detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes a dataset of labeled messages to train a machine learning model to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

## Features

- Utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn for model training.
- Implements various NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and classification algorithms.
- Provides easy-to-use scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance.
